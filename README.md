# Topological-Sort-DFS-
Topological sort is an algorithm that takes a directed acyclic graph and returns the sequence
of nodes where every node will appear before other nodes that it points to. Topological
sorting for graphs is not applicable if the graph is not a Directed Acyclic Graph. In it, directed
acyclic graph is the operation of arranging the nodes in the order in such a way that if there
exists an edge (i,j), i precedes j in the lists. A topological sort basically gives a sequence in
which we should perform the job and helps us to check whether the graph consists of the
cycle or not. Every graph can have more than one topological sorting possible.
